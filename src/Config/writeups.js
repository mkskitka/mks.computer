The project takes form as a movement interface to code that uses the live code langauge, sonic pi, a rasperberry pi, and arduino. 
The custom built handheld device allows me to perform coding wirelessly, without internet, while still being tethered to the syntax and execution process. 
The arduino IMF classifies the wearer's movement data which is converted to code, then sound as it is executed in real time.`

all we can do is do our best to relish this remarkable ride.

Drift bottle is a exploration game built with Unity game engine.
During the game, the bottle will drift through the waves towards it's destingation the island. 
The player can grab the glass bottle controller and perform different interactions, 
like shaking, tilting, and circulating. The results of these interactions are changing wave intensity, sea level, 
lighting, weather, and the orientation of the bottle itself.
Ultimately, the bottle will approach an island and when the bottle is ashore, 
the player will be instructed to open the bottle and take out the message inside.
I contributed to design and development of the 3d unity environement and programmed the serial communication
with the physical controller.`
